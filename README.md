   - **Interactive Design:** Enable dynamic visuals through slicers and field parameters.  

## Steps to Create the Dashboard
1. **Understand the Data:**  
   - Two data sources: Trip Details Fact Table and Location Dimension Table.  
   - Examine relationships and data types for accurate analysis.

2. **Load Data:**  
   - Import Trip Details and Location Dimension tables into Power BI Desktop.

3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Clean and standardize data using Power Query.  
   - Create new columns and replace inconsistent values.

4. **Data Modeling:**  
   - Create a date table for time-based analysis.  
   - Define relationships between fact and dimension tables.

5. **DAX Calculations:**  
   - Write measures for KPIs like total trips, fare, duration, and distance.  
   - Add calculated columns such as day/night trip classification.

6. **Visualizations:**  
   - Use charts, maps, and KPI visuals to represent data.  
   - Design a layout emphasizing clarity and accessibility.

7. **Publish and Share:**  
   - Publish the report to Power BI Service and configure sharing settings.

## Key Insights
